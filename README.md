## Objective
Create centralized documentation for ESP32-based communication with Honeywell WV8840 water heater controllers using EnviraCOM protocol.

## Documentation Structure Needed

### 1. Protocol Documentation
- [ ] Document EnviraCOM protocol specifications
- [ ] Hardware interface requirements (3.3V TTL, pinout)
- [ ] Message format and framing details
- [ ] CRC calculation methods

### 2. Hardware Setup Guide  
- [ ] ESP32 connection diagrams
- [ ] Bill of materials for interface board
- [ ] Safety considerations for water heater connections
- [ ] Alternative connection methods (direct vs W8735 adapter)

### 3. Software Implementation
- [ ] Port roy-bentley/enviracom protocol parser to ESP32
- [ ] Create ESPHome custom component structure
- [ ] Arduino library for basic communication
- [ ] Home Assistant integration examples

### 4. Reference Materials
- [ ] Compile existing research links and resources
- [ ] Community forum discussions and findings  
- [ ] Commercial alternatives comparison
- [ ] Troubleshooting guide

## Key Resources to Document
- roy-bentley/enviracom GitHub repository
- W8735A1005 specification sheet
- Bloominglabs reverse engineering work
- Raspberry Pi forum discussions
- ESPHome-econet as architectural reference

## Success Criteria
- Complete hardware setup guide for ESP32 connection
- Working protocol implementation for basic communication
- Integration examples for Home Assistant
- Clear migration path from existing solutions
